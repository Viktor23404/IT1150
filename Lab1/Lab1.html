<h1>HTML Introduction</h1>
<p>My name is Viktor Budik</p>
<p>I hope to learn about coding in this class</p>
<p>I became interested in computers and programming because I always found it to be interesting</p>
<p>After graduating Tri-C I plan to find a decent job</p>
<p>My two big goals: being successful and useful to other people</p>
